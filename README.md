# 1D-ARRAY
Code playground for manipulating one dimensional arrays

DL the file dupliArr.c and get started! Be creative! 

also, I highly discourage copy pasting form the internet! Read if you must, but type it in your own!

Notes as of 12:53PM OCT 22, 2019:
- case 'd' arranging an array with nested case 'sort part of array' in descending order does not work haha
- may need to sort all cases into functions for a better looking program...
- think a way to make case 'e' identify specific positions (quantiles, anyone?) not just largest / smallest and second largest/ second smallest (for example identify 5th largest[has to be user input] in the array, etc.)

luv u (uwu)
