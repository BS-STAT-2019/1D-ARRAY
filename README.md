# 1D-ARRAY
Code playground for manipulating one dimensional arrays

Notes as of 12:53PM OCT 22, 2019:
- case 'd' arranging an array with nested case 'sort part of array' in descending order does not work haha
- may need to sort all cases into functions for a better looking program...
- think a way to make case 'e' identify specific positions (quantiles, anyone?) not just largest / smallest and second largest/ second smallest

luv u (uwu)
